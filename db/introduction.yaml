           experience different cultures, meet people and make friends and most importantly learn something from them.
- question: What is my expertise ?
  answer: I love <b>Ruby</b>, <b>"Ruby on Rails"</b> and <b>"Amazon Web Services"</b>.
          I like to create re-usable and tested software components and code through <b>"Object Oriented Programming"
          </b>.I also follow the best practise of writing the test cases first and then the actual code by following
          <b>"Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)"</b> process. I use <b>"Test Units"
          ,"RSpec" and "Factory Girl"</b> for writing test cases.
- question:
  answer:  I follow <b>"Usability"</b> techniques for creating effective user interfaces. I have worked on <b>"MySql", "PostgrSql" and "mongodb"</b>.
          I can create rich UI's in HTML and dynamic UI's using javascript.
          <p>Basically everything between the front-end and back-end.
           <p>The site you are currently visiting is the result of all these technologies.
           <p>However, beyond front-ends and back-ends there is more to software applications. Applications should also be
           highly-available, fault tolerant and scalable to keep our beloved users happy and ever increasing.
           Applications deployment should be automated, smooth and without human interferance.
           I can automate your applications deployment using Chef,Puppet either on your own premise or on cloud -
           <b>"AWS", "Heroku" and "Azure"</b>. See <a href="https://desolate-beyond-6545.herokuapp.com/work"

- question: Am I the best of all over there ?
  answer: I will make efforts to be best for you.<br>
          Does'nt matter how much foolish or idiots we are individually, collectively we can create rocking softwares.
          <p id="answer">Early this year (2015), I <b>achieved 4 out of 5 rating from a US client for my work </b>.
          But I think I am still and would remain a student forever and keep the learning process going on.
- question: Are my applications world class ?
  answer: No, they are end user class.
- question: Do I provide world class architecture ?
  answer: No, I provide right architecture.
- question: How do I provide right architecture ?
  answer: By following best practises and keeping myself updated. They say, “Technology is temporary and class is
          permanent”. Since our work is knowledge driven, every day I read something new and sometimes also something
          which I already know to understand it deeply. You never know which knowledge will help you where.
          Got golden opportunities to work with products of some of the Fortune 100 companies.
          Interacting with <b>"Rails Community"</b> world wide helps me to know it better.
          Contributing to <b>"Rails Open Source Project"</b> allows me to apply my knowledge.

          Upwork</a> - remote job provider company. I also have the infrastructure
          needed for working and collaborating with remote teams.
