          <strong>Why you should give me work</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>I have dual expertise of designing web applications/services as well as designing and architecting their
              deployment, management and business continuity on cloud.  Hence if you are planing to use cloud,
              hiring me will save your expenses as well as time. If you dont hire me, you will require seperate
              person(s)/team(s) for application designing and cloud expertise. This will increase your
              expenses and eat your time as your communication channels have increased
              <li>I dont work seriously, but sincerely.</li>
              <li>I deliver work satisfying your expectations with minimal supervision.
              <li>I follow the best practise of writing unit tests first then the actual code.
              <li>I have good written, verbal and presentation skills.
              <li>I have 6 years experienced in designing and developing web applications and web services using
              REST and Service Oriented Architecture
